instructions: {
	This is a text based game.
	Whenever the game tells you
	to "press" something, it 
	means to type that word and 
	press "Enter".

	At any point of free gameplay,
	meaning moving around, press
	"menu" to pull up Steve, the menu.
	He's really helpful. Legit. You can
	do all sorts of, in some cases necessary,
	things there. Also, press the first letter 
	of the first word of the name of a place 
	to go there, if it is an option. It has to be 
	in lower case.

	exceptions: on the road areas and the numbered rooms, 
	type the corresponding number.

This game saves with a password system.
When entering a password given when in the
first section of the game, you will start at
the start point of that section. When entering
a password received when in the second section 
of the game, you will start at the start point
of that section. In both of these instances, 
your progress in every other category will be 
restored the same as when you received the password.
You do not receive passwords upon death. You only receive
them by pressing quit in the pause menu. 
Getting into the Kilge base is the checkpoint,
any password received after that point will start
you at the start of the inside of it upon entering.

items: 

health restoring items:
water bottles:
	represented in game as "water". drink one
	to gain 30 health points. drink them in
	battle or in the menu. They are obtained by
	finding them in different areas and completing 
	different tasks.
		
cactus juice: 
	another drink. These give 80 health points
	when you drink one. You can only drink them in
	the menu, however. Find them by defeating
	certain beings or trading with locals.
			
weapons: 
	weapons each have a number value. you can see what it
	is by going to the menu, Steve. The number value of the
	weapon is multiplied by a set amount of damage in battle.
	here's an example:
	fists have a value of 1.
	bone spear has a value of 2.
	if the standard set damage is 5, a bone spear does 10
	damage, while fists only do five. 

	you can switch your weapon between ones you have 
	found in the menu. 

	different weapons have different advantages and
	disadvantages. choose your preference.

	the number in the following list is the attack value.
	this does not take into effect various pros and cons
	like missing and distance.

fists: 1
	starter weapon. very low damage.

bone spear: 2
	a basic weapon able to be found as the very first 
	thing you can do in the game. gives you a fighting
	chance.

rustic sword: 2.5
	man! this thing is KEWL, but not super awesome. 
	Still a little better than bone spear. 

old bow: 3
	attack from farther. take less damage. slight
	risk of missing.

pistol: 5
	attack from farther. take less damage. do lots of damage.
	slight risk of missing.

rifle: 8
	attack from REALLY far away. Take very little damage. do lots
	of damage, with a good risk of missing...

shotgun: 10
	attack from up close like swords. Do MEGA damage. random
	one in five chance your opponent gets to attack twice,
	whilst you reload. damage is random and not consistent.

bazooka: 20
	do devastating damage. opponent attacks you 2 times
	each turn whilst you reload. low risk of missing. attack
	from far. take less damage.

there are a few other weapons, but you can discover those
yourself.	


how attacking works:

you can do three things in a battle:
1. basic attack.
2. special attack.
3. drink water.

basic attack has a standard amount of damage of 5.
this is multiplied by whatever value your weapon has.
However, this number can be increased by doing certain
actions in the game. To start out, special attack is
clearly the better of the two. Depending on what you do,
this may change.
(While using the bazooka, basic attack is the same as 
special attack.)

special attack has a random standard amount of damage
each turn. It can be anywhere from 1 to 12. This number
is multiplied by your weapon value.

enemies:

spider:
tutorial enemy. very easy. used to get the hang of the game.

sandstorm:
not really a battle. just bad luck...

lion:
quite dangerous, but manageable.

local:
a desert inhabitant. some are friendly. some attack you.
hope that doesn't happen.

there are other enemies, but you can discover those 
yourself.


HINTS:

go to the small cave before the oasis. you get 
your first weapon there.

each area, with a few excpetions, has a random chance to have enemies in
it. That means that some areas might have nothing, 
while some have more than one battle. Make sure to
restore your health before entering an area. 

each area, again with excpetions,
also has a chance to have different items.
BTW,
there is no maximum amount of health points ;)

ENJOY THE GAME!
